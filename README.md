 An Access database for loading and monitoring of cardiology patient studies

Language of the database:
Spanish

¿What is this project about?
An Access database for loading and monitoring of cardiology patient studies

¿How does it work?
In the forms "Carga de..." load the patients depending on the type of study.
In the "Consulta de..." queries there are the database spreadsheets.
The program will remember the patients previously loaded after loading the document and pressing TAB.
Filter the group "Custom Group 1". Thus the tables, reports and other elements not used directly 
will be hidden for the user.
